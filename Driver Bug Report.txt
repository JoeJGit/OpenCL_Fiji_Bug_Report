This Project seems to proof a Driver Bug on FuryX (No issues on Tahiti 7950).
My Fury works for games and it does not seem broken, all tests on Windows 10.

The Kernel calculates a simple prefix sum and generates a log file with results.
Fury gets correct results only in x64 - 32bit is broken.
See included copies of my logs.

The prefix sum uses an offset of +1 see kernel code:

_texCount[(wr_id)+1] += _texCount[(rd_id)+1]; 

If i change this offset to 0,2,3,4,5,16... it works. Only 1 causes the bug.

My Project Path is C:\dev\OpenCL_test


I came on this because i have a similar problem with Vulkan. 
See here for Discussion:

I was not yet able to reproduce it outside my application, but it may be connected.
